    <p> Zen garden is a webpage which allows web page creators to work on premade web layouts to work on and change as per needed. This allows for the creators to not remake every different CSS code from scratch and save a lot of time, but also allows them to first select a code which fits the desired look best, then tweak it as per their needs. It also provides quality web-page layouts for beginners to learn.

    <h2> The different themes      </h2>
    The repertoire of themes is huge and you can select any one that is needed and fits best in the start; of course, changes can be made accordingly.
    <h3>
    My favorite theme: Ragged
    </h3>

    This is my favorite webpage because of its simplicity and stylistic elements. The white complements the red in the highlights. Furthermore, it uses other CSS stylistic elements like centered paragraphs, and boxes. Also, it uses a version of image-heading with the text "CSS ZEN GARDEN", which is something we hadn't been taught in the book; in the book, the heading we learned was regular headings and changing its font style, size, color and position. But, not an entirely different core of the heading such as that seen in the image for the Ragged layout.
